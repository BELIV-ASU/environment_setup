Welcome to BELIV Lab!
''''
  
Welcome to the Battery ELectric & Intelligent Vehicle (BELIV) lab at Arizona State University! We work on the design, optimization, and controls of advanced systems, including connected and 
automated vehicles, battery electric vehicles, and smart mobility. We believe our multidisciplinary research program will contribute to the development of safe, clean, and energy-efficient 
intelligent vehicles and transportation systems, which will shape the future of mobility and have long-term benefits to society. We are part of The Polytechnic School at the Ira A. Fulton 
Schools of Engineering. The lab is directed by Dr. Junfeng Zhao, an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University.
